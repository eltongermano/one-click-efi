# One-Click BIOS
A GNOME extension that allows you to restart into firmware settings directly from OS.<br>
Currently supports: GNOME 43.

## Usage:
1. Press the aggregate menu as usual
2. Hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> and click the power button
3. Done! Proceed with the next dialog appeared. The computer will now restart straight into your BIOS/UEFI settings automatically!

## Note:
This is my first GNOME extension and this is my first time using GJS. I learned most of the code from the GitLab repo `GNOME/gnome-shell` and so there are still some part that I don't understand. Feel free to provide me any suggestions!
